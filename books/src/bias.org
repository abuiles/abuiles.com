* Confirmation bias
The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information
in a way that confirms or strengthens one's prior personal beliefs or
hypotheses.
* Self-fulfilling prophecy
Self-fulfilling prophecy refers to the socio-psychological phenomenon
of someone "predicting" or expecting something, and this "prediction"
or expectation comes true simply because one believes it will, and
their resulting behaviors align to fulfil those beliefs.
