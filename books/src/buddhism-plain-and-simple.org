This is my first approximation to Buddhism; I ended up reading this book because a friend recommended it while we were having a conversation about Stoicism and Adlerian psychology.

I found the ideas in the book easy to grasp; however, there are still some concepts that I'll have to sit on and digest.

I tend to take a very rational approach to the world, and here's where I feel my views collide with some of the ideas in Buddhism, specifically when talking about Reality and Truth.

After reading this, I can see why my friend recommended the book; many of the ideas here converge with ideas from Stoicism, Adler, and even Adam Smith's theories of moral sentiment.

Overall a good read; I'm looking forward to studying more about Buddhism and update my beliefs and views of the world.
