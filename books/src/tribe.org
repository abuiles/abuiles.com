Rating: ⭐⭐

A thought provoking book which explores the meaning of the word
"tribe", the psychological and bonding effects of war and
catastrophes, and the unfortunate toll imposed by modern society in
both the environment and community feeling.

I'm conflicted about this book, I liked the content, however, I was
expecting more substance; If you are looking to explore more about the
meaning of community feeling and the theory of self-reliance, then I'd
recommend "The Courage to Be Disliked" instead.
