Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

This was one of my favorite books about the links between nutrition
and disease.  Every year there is a new nutrition fad; we get overwhelmed
with information telling us to eat more of this and less of that
without real data to back such claims.

This book goes through all the major disease in the U.S and then tell
us what has been scientifically proven to help to prevent those
disease.

Many of the studies mentioned in the book were randomized double
blind placebo control;  in the scenarios where the data wasn't yet
backed by substantial evidence, the author would be clear about it and
explain the reasoning for still backing up such data.

I'm giving this book 4 stars and will revisit in a couple of
months. As a quantified-self nerd, I'm eager to put into practice some
of the things mentioned in the book.

** Bio markers
- Optimal LDL cholesterol should be 50-70 mg/dl

** How not to die from Heart Disease

Cholesterol is the true risk factor for coronary heart disease.

Optimal LDL cholesterol should be 50-70 mg/dl. To lower cholesterol, we need to avoid three things:

1. Trans fats: junk food and animal products
2. Saturated fats: https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/diet/foodsources/sat_fat/crf.html
3. Cholesterol: https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/diet/foodsources/cholesterol/table1.html

Researches used to blame animal fat or animal protein for clogging the arteries, however, recent attention has shifted to a bacterial toxin known as "endotoxins". Certain food like meat appear to harbor bacteria that can trigger inflammation. The end-up up in the blood stream triggering an inflammatory reaction in your arteries. https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-exogenous-endotoxin-theory/

There is no clinical evidence to support that omega-3 helps preventing heart disease. (p20)

*** Questions
**** Where does cholesterol come from?

[[https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-its-made-cholesterol-production-in-your-body][Our body (liver and intestines) produces 80% of the cholesterol we need to stay healthy and 20% come from food.]]

** How not to die from Lung Diseases
- Don't smoke
- Turmeric/curcumin act as carcinogenic blockers and antioxidants, that help prevent the initial triggering of mutations.
- A quarter of lung cancers occur to people who never smoke.
- Fumes from frying are another potentially carcinogenic.
- Air pollution might increase COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
- Fruits and vegetables are positively associated with good lung functions.
- Cured meats might increase the risk of COPD.
- Removing eggs and diary has been shown to improve asthmatic children 's lung functioning.

*** What to eat?
- Turmeric/curcumin
- Fruits and vegetables
- Broccoli
- Cruciferous and allium veggies
** How not to die from Brain Diseases
*** Strokes
- What is a stroke? A stroke can be thought as a "brain attack" - like
  "heart attacks", but the rupturing plaques in your arteries cut off
  blood flow to parts of the brain rather than to parts of the
  heart. It deprives the brain from oxygen and kills off the part fed
  by the clogged artery. This is called a ischemic stroke.
- A healthy diet can reduce stroke risk by reducing cholesterol and blood  pressure while improving blood flow and antioxidant capacity.
- [[file:fiber-stroke.pdf][A number of studies have shown that a high fiber intake may help ward off stroke]].
- Increasing fiber intake by just seven grams a day may be associated with a 7% risk reduction.
- Fiber is naturally concentrated in whole plant foods.
- Processed foods have less, and animal-derived foods have no fiber at all.
-  There is no clear link yet how fiber protects the brain . The
  current hypothesis is that fiber helps control cholesterol and blood
  sugar levels, which can help reduce the amount of artery-clogging
  plaque in your brain's blood vessels.
- High fiber diets may also lower blood pressure which reduces the risk of brain bleeds.
- [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23317525][The best available science suggest you can minimize stroke by eating
  a minimum of 25 grams a day of soluble fiber (fiber that dissolves
  in water, typically found in beans, oats, nuts and berries) and 47
  daily grams of insoluble fiber (fiber that does not dissolve in
  water, found primary in whole grains, such as brown rice and whole
  wheat)]].
- Potassium can help reduce stroke risk.
- Bananas have been marketed as rich in potassium but they are not.
- Citrus has been associated with reduced stroke risk.
- Lack of sleep has been associated with stroke risk.
- Antioxidant rich foods might help prevent stroke.
- On average, plant foods contain 64 times more antioxidants that animal foods.
- [[https://bit.ly/antioxidantfoods][The antioxidant food table]].
- The food category that averages most antioxidants is herbs and spices.
- Antioxidant rich diets appear to protect against stroke by preventing
  the circulation of oxidized fats in the bloodstream that can damage
  the sensitive walls of small blood vessels in the brain.
- The can also help decrease artery stiffness, prevent blood clots
  from forming, and lower blood pressure and inflammation.

*** Alzheimer's
- What is Alzheimer's? It is more like a "mind attack" - instead of
  cholesterol-filled plaques in your arteries, plaques made of a
  substance called amyloid develop in the brain tissue itself,
  associated with the loss of memory and, eventually, loss of life.
*** What to eat?
- Oatmeal.
- Berries.
- Beans.
- Broccoli.
- 25 grams a day of soluble fiber: Like beans, oats, nuts and berries.
- 47 daily grams of insoluble fiber.
- Potassium rich foods like: greens, beans, and sweet potatoes.
- Citrus fruits.
- Foods rich in antioxidants.
- Herbs and spices.
