Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

This was one of my favorite books about the links between nutrition
and disease.  Every year there is a new nutrition fad; we get overwhelmed
with information telling us to eat more of this and less of that
without real data to back such claims.

This book goes through all the major disease in the U.S and then tell
us what has been scientifically proven to help to prevent those
disease.

Many of the studies mentioned in the book were randomized double
blind placebo control;  in the scenarios where the data wasn't yet
backed by substantial evidence, the author would be clear about it and
explain the reasoning for still backing up such data.

I'm giving this book 4 stars and will revisit in a couple of
months. As a quantified-self nerd, I'm eager to put into practice some
of the things mentioned in the book.

** Bio markers
- Optimal LDL cholesterol should be 50-70 mg/dl

** How not to die from Heart Disease

Cholesterol is the true risk factor for coronary heart disease.

Optimal LDL cholesterol should be 50-70 mg/dl. To lower cholesterol, we need to avoid three things:

1. Trans fats: junk food and animal products
2. Saturated fats: https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/diet/foodsources/sat_fat/crf.html
3. Cholesterol: https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/diet/foodsources/cholesterol/table1.html

Researches used to blame animal fat or animal protein for clogging the arteries, however, recent attention has shifted to a bacterial toxin known as "endotoxins". Certain food like meat appear to harbor bacteria that can trigger inflammation. The end-up up in the blood stream triggering an inflammatory reaction in your arteries. https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-exogenous-endotoxin-theory/

There is no clinical evidence to support that omega-3 helps preventing heart disease. (p20)

** How not to die from Lung Diseases
- Don't smoke
- Turmeric/curcumin act as carcinogenic blockers and antioxidants, that help prevent the initial triggering of mutations.
- A quarter of lung cancers occur to people who never smoke.
- Fumes from frying are another potentially carcinogenic.
- Air pollution might increase COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
- Fruits and vegetables are positively associated with good lung functions.
- Cured meats might increase the risk of COPD.
- Removing eggs and diary has been shown to improve asthmatic children 's lung functioning.
- [[https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lung-cancer/][Topic page on nutritionfacts]]

*** What to eat?
- Turmeric/curcumin
- Fruits and vegetables
- Broccoli
- Cruciferous and allium veggies
** How not to die from Brain Diseases
*** Strokes
- What is a stroke? A stroke can be thought as a "brain attack" - like
  "heart attacks", but the rupturing plaques in your arteries cut off
  blood flow to parts of the brain rather than to parts of the
  heart. It deprives the brain from oxygen and kills off the part fed
  by the clogged artery. This is called a ischemic stroke.
- A healthy diet can reduce stroke risk by reducing cholesterol and blood  pressure while improving blood flow and antioxidant capacity.
- [[file:fiber-stroke.pdf][A number of studies have shown that a high fiber intake may help ward off stroke]].
- Increasing fiber intake by just seven grams a day may be associated with a 7% risk reduction.
- Fiber is naturally concentrated in whole plant foods.
- Processed foods have less, and animal-derived foods have no fiber at all.
-  There is no clear link yet how fiber protects the brain . The
  current hypothesis is that fiber helps control cholesterol and blood
  sugar levels, which can help reduce the amount of artery-clogging
  plaque in your brain's blood vessels.
- High fiber diets may also lower blood pressure which reduces the risk of brain bleeds.
- [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23317525][The best available science suggest you can minimize stroke by eating
  a minimum of 25 grams a day of soluble fiber (fiber that dissolves
  in water, typically found in beans, oats, nuts and berries) and 47
  daily grams of insoluble fiber (fiber that does not dissolve in
  water, found primary in whole grains, such as brown rice and whole
  wheat)]].
- Potassium can help reduce stroke risk.
- Bananas have been marketed as rich in potassium but they are not.
- Citrus has been associated with reduced stroke risk.
- Lack of sleep has been associated with stroke risk.
- Antioxidant rich foods might help prevent stroke.
- On average, plant foods contain 64 times more antioxidants that animal foods.
- [[https://bit.ly/antioxidantfoods][The antioxidant food table]].
- The food category that averages most antioxidants is herbs and spices.
- Antioxidant rich diets appear to protect against stroke by preventing
  the circulation of oxidized fats in the bloodstream that can damage
  the sensitive walls of small blood vessels in the brain.
- The can also help decrease artery stiffness, prevent blood clots
  from forming, and lower blood pressure and inflammation.

*** Alzheimer's
- What is Alzheimer's? It is more like a "mind attack" - instead of
  cholesterol-filled plaques in your arteries, plaques made of a
  substance called amyloid develop in the brain tissue itself,
  associated with the loss of memory and, eventually, loss of life.

- [[https://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.d7622][There is an emerging consensus that "what is good for our heart is
  also good for our heads"]], [[https://mayoclinic.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/intracranial-atherosclerosis-as-a-contributing-factor-to-alzheime][because clogging of the arteries inside of
  the brain with atherosclerotic plaque is thought to play a pivotal
  role in the development of Alzheimer's disease.]]
- Alzheimer's brains have significantly more cholesterol build up that
  normal brains.
- Cholesterol in the brain is not separate from cholesterol in the blood.
- [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24037034][The closest correlation researches found between diet and dementia
  was animal fat consumption.]]
- [[https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/advanced-glycation-end-products/][Advanced Glycation End-products]] (AGEs), also known as aging toxins
  are thought to accelerate the aging process by cross-linking
  proteins together, causing tissue stiffness, oxidative stress and
  inflammation.
- Autopsy studies show the loss of sirtuin activity may be closely
  associated with the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease—namely, the
  accumulation of plaques and tangles in the brain.
- We can prevent the loss of sirtuin by reducing our dietary exposure
  to advanced glycation end products, or AGEs.
- The top five most AGE-contaminated products per serving tested were
  BBQ chicken, followed by bacon, broiled hot dog, roasted chicken
  thigh, and roasted chicken leg.
- Aerobic exercise can help improve cerebral blood flood, improve
  memory performance and help preserve brain tissue.

*** What to eat?
- Oatmeal.
- Berries.
  - Blueberries (help increase memory ability).
  - Strawberries.
  - concord grapes which are rich in polyphenols.
- Beans.
- Broccoli.
- 25 grams a day of soluble fiber: Like beans, oats, nuts and berries.
- 47 daily grams of insoluble fiber.
- Potassium rich foods like: greens, beans, and sweet potatoes.
- Citrus fruits.
- Foods rich in antioxidants.
- Herbs and spices (which are rich in antioxidants).
- Some foods rich in [[https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/polyphenols/][polyphenols]] are associated with [[https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-slow-brain-aging-by-two-years/][delayed cognitive aging.]]
- Saffron.

** How not to die from Digestive Cancer

- There are different kinds of digestive cancers, like:
  1. Colorectal (one of the most treatable if caught early)
  2. Pancreatic (a death sentence)
  3. Esophageal (affects the tube between mouth and the stomach)

- The foods you eat can indirectly affect cancer risk, for example, by exacerbating acid reflux, a risk factor for esophageal cancer, or through direct contact with the lining of the digestive tract.

*** Colorectal cancer

- The emergence of colorectal cancer can be broken down into three stages:
  1. The first sign is what are called "aberrant crypt foci" or abnormal clusters of cells along the lining of the colon.
  2. Next come polyps that grow from that inner surface.
  3. A benign polyp transforms into a cancerous one. The cancer can eat through the wall of the colon and spread throughout the body.

- [[https://cancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org/content/4/3/354.figures-only][Investigators have found that curcumin consumption could reduce the number of  cancer-associated structures in the rectum.]]

- Spices consumption in India might be relate with its low cancer rate, but they also consume other foods that are packed with another class of cancer-fighting compounds called phytates.

*** Phytates

- Phytates have been shown to detoxify excess iron in the body, which otherwise can generate a particularly harmful kind of free radical called hydroxyl radicals.
- [[https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/1097-0142(19850815)56:4%253C717::AID-CNCR2820560402%253E3.0.CO;2-4][Phytates are found in all whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds.]]
- Those who eat ore high-phythate foods tend to have a greater bone mineral density, less bone loss, and fewer hip fractures.
- [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6862688][There may be as much as an height-fold difference in colorectal cancer risk between the two extremes -- high-vegetable, low-meat diets and low-vegetable, high-meat diets.]]
- Is not enough to cut down meat intake, you also need to eat more plants.
- [[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327914nc5502_1?journalCode=hnuc20][Besides affecting the cancer cells directly, phytates have been found to boost the activity of natural killer cells, which are white blood cells that form your first line of defense by hunting down and disposing of cancer cells.]]
- Phytates can starve  tumors of their blood supply.
- Phytates can cause cancer cells to apparently revert back to their normal state.

- What does meat contain that may raise the risk of premature death? One of the possibilities is heme iron, the form of  iron predominantly in blood and muscle.
- Iron can be considered a double edge-sword: too little of it might produce anemia, too much and you may increase risk of cancer and heart disease.

*** Pancreatic cancer
- This cancer isn't very common, however, it is lethal. Just 6% of patients survive five years after diagnosis.
- Risk factors include obesity and heavy alcohol consumption.
- There has been debate between the risk of pancreatic cancer and fat consumption - however, fat from animal sources was significantly associated with pancreatic cancer risk, but no correlation was found with the consumption of plant fats.
- There are viruses known to cause cancer in birds, and there are concerns this viruses might be causing cancer in humans, however, this is unknown.
- Those who slaughter chicken have a 9 times the odds of pancreatic cancer and liver cancer.


*** Esophageal cancer
- Esophageal cancer occurs when cells develop in the esophagus, the muscular tube carrying food from your mouth to your stomach.
- Typically, the cancer arises in the lining of the esophagus and then invades the outer layers before metastasizing to other organs.
- Acid reflux can lead to adenocarcinoma (the most common type of esophageal cancer)
- Studies between the links of diet, Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer, have found  that the most consistent association with cancer was the consumption of meat and high-fat meals.
- Different meats were associated with cancers in different locations:
  1. Red meat is strongly associated with cancer in the esophagus.
  2. Poultry is more strongly associated with cancer down around the stomach esophagus border.
- Within five minutes of eating fat, your sphincter muscle at the top of your stomach - which acts like a valve to keep down food inside the stomach - relaxes, allowing acids to creep back up into the esophagus.

- Centering your diet around antioxidant-rich plant foods may cut in half your odds of esophageal cancer.

- The most protective foods for cancer at the esophagus-stomach border appear to be red, orange, and dark-green vegetables, berries, apples, and citrus fruits.

- High-fiber intake may reduce the incidence of esophageal cancer by as much as one-third by helping to prevent the root cause of many cases of acid reflux: the herniation of part of the stomach up into the chest cavity (known as hiatal hernia).

- [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3135745][Humans evolved eating huge amounts of fiber, likely in excess of one hundred grams daily.]]

*** What to eat?
- Turmeric.
- Dark-green, leafy vegetables (rich in phytates).
- Legumes: beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils.
- Berries.
- Whole grains (also rich in Iron).
- Nuts.
- Seeds.
- Dried fruit.
- Avoid drinking tea with meals since it can inhibit iron absorption.
- Consuming vitamin C-rich foods can improve iron absorption.
- The most protective foods for cancer at the esophagus-stomach border appear to be red, orange, and dark-green vegetables, berries, apples, and citrus fruits.
- Strawberries.
