Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

This was one of my favorite books about the links between nutrition
and disease.  Every year there is a new nutrition fad; we get overwhelmed
with information telling us to eat more of this and less of that
without real data to back such claims.

This book goes through all the major disease in the U.S and then tell
us what has been scientifically proven to help to prevent those
disease.

Many of the studies mentioned in the book were randomized double
blind placebo control;  in the scenarios where the data wasn't yet
backed by substantial evidence, the author would be clear about it and
explain the reasoning for still backing up such data.

I'm giving this book 4 stars and will revisit in a couple of
months. As a quantified-self nerd, I'm eager to put into practice some
of the things mentioned in the book.

** How not to die from Heart Disease

Cholesterol is the true risk factor for coronary heart disease.

Optimal LDL cholesterol should be 50-70 mg/dl. To lower cholesterol, we need to avoid three things:

1. Trans fats: junk food and animal products
2. Saturated fats: https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/diet/foodsources/sat_fat/crf.html
3. Cholesterol: https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/diet/foodsources/cholesterol/table1.html

Researches used to blame animal fat or animal protein for clogging the arteries, however, recent attention has shifted to a bacterial toxin known as "endotoxins". Certain food like meat appear to harbor bacteria that can trigger inflammation. The end-up up in the blood stream triggering an inflammatory reaction in your arteries. https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-exogenous-endotoxin-theory/

There is no clinical evidence to support that omega-3 helps preventing heart disease. (p20)
