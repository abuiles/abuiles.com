Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

This was one of my favorite books about the links between nutrition
and disease.  Every year there is a new nutrition fad; we get overwhelmed
with information telling us to eat more of this and less of that
without real data to back such claims.

This book goes through all the major disease in the U.S and then tell
us what has been scientifically proven to help to prevent those
disease.

Many of the studies mentioned in the book were randomized double
blind placebo control;  in the scenarios where the data wasn't yet
backed by substantial evidence, the author would be clear about it and
explain the reasoning for still backing up such data.

I'm giving this book 4 stars and will revisit in a couple of
months. As a quantified-self nerd, I'm eager to put into practice some
of the things mentioned in the book.
